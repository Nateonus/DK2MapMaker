# Dungeon Keeper 2 Map Maker by Nateonus
The DK2 Map Maker is an unofficial application to build Dungeon Keeper 2 maps within a 3D environment.

## Why?
Dungeon Keeper 2 is an exceptional game, and I wish there were more maps for the game. I wanted to make my own maps, however I find the existing DK2 editor difficult to use. Creating a new map can be jarring due to an old UI, an uncooperative navigation system, and a forced 2D view. 

I believe that visualizing the map in 3D during creation will allow map creators, amateur or experienced, to have a much easier time making maps.

## Features
The DK2 map maker can:
- Place terrain
- Place rooms
- Export maps for skirmish or multiplayer
 
In the future, the DK2 map maker may be able to:
- Place doors
- Place traps
- Place 'things'
- Place creatures

## How to: Using this to make mapsC
This map maker has the basic functions of map building for DK2. It doesn't have functionality to add scripts or change level properties, however the map maker can still be used to make these complex maps.

### Basic Maps
1. Launch the app and design your map. When finished, use the export option to export your map into a set of files used for DK2 levels (KWD and KLD).
2. Use the export option to create a set of KWD and KLD files for DK2.
3. Place these files within the maps folder of DK2 (DK2/Data/editor/maps).
4. Load the game and find your map in the skirmish menu.
5. Play or distribute your map!

### Complex Maps (for experienced map-makers)
1. Launch the app and design your map.
2. Use the export option to create a set of KWD and KLD files for DK2.
3. Load the KWD file using the DK2 editor.
4. Add scripts, change properties, or other complex features.
5. Export your map.
